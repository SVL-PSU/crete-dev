# CRETE: Versatile Binary-Level Concolic Testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SVL-PSU/crete-dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SVL-PSU/crete-dev)

`CRETE` is a versatile binary-level concolic testing framework developed by
the System Validation Lab at Portland State University. It can be applied to
various kinds of software systems for test case generation and bug detection,
including proprietary user-level programs, closed-source libraries, kernel
modules, etc.

## Highlights

* Open and extensible architecture: totally decoupled concrete and symbolic
  execution from virtual machine
* Standardized execution trace: llvm-based, self-contained, and composable
* Binary-level analysis: no source code or debug information required
* In-vivo analysis: use real full software stack and require no environment
  modeling
* Compact execution trace: selective binary-level tracing based on Dynamic Taint
  Analysis
* Trace/test selection and scheduling algorithms to improve effectiveness
* Simple usage model: no expertise required and accessible for general users
